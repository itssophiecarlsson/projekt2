            London Martin moved to Scotland and turned professional photographer in 2003 - his true calling and a lifelong passion.<br><br>
            Initially working predominately with British newspapers and periodicals, but quickly expanding internationally. 
            One thing led to another, opportunities arose within corporate and commercial assignments, as well as catalogue work
            for brand clothing and lingerie companies, event and even wedding work, always alongside general stock photography.<br><br>
            By the end of 2006 the family upped their sticks and moved to Martin's native country of Sweden, ready for another challenge.
            Currently residing in the beautiful, tranquil village of Floda, right on the doorstep of Säveån's nature reserve.<br><br>
            A gifted, hard-working professional - calm, experienced, versatile and highly creative - always getting things done, properly -
            "I shoot with heart and humour, always ensuring that I do my very best to make the very best".<br><br>
            A creative with a high level of logical thinking, wide-ranging unique experiences and challenging enviroments.
            I'm extremely adaptable and very well equipped at problem-solving and finding solutions. I respond well to and rise
            to any challenge. A person that many turn to, for answers, for guidance, put trust into to find solutions and the ability
            to delegate accordingly - something that I'm used to and comfortable with. Combine this with the ability of assuming 
            serious responsibility, highly energised unconstrained thinking and you'll get the ability to "getting things done, properly".
